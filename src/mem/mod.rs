//! In-memory data structures
//!
//! All in-memory data structures rely on `Timestamps` trait to handle
//! timestamp bookkeeping. Basic idea is that you scan your metrics at
//! a regular intervals and at each timestamp you have loads of metrics, so
//! it's ineffiecient to store a timestamp per metric.
//!
//! So `Timestamps` is a holder for timestamps. Basically it's an array of
//! timestamps, and "age" value for each. The `age` value is an
//! ever-incrementing counter. With first timestamp you captures having an
//! age of `1`.
//!
//! When metric is updated it stores current age of the `Timestamps` array.
//! When you read metrics it can sync timestamps with stored metrics by
//! calculating the difference between current age and last age stored for
//! specific metric. This way if you don't update metric for some time it
//! still doesn't get out of sync with timestamps. When you update metric
//! after some inactivity period it is filled with "undefined" values for
//! all timestamps in-between.
//!
//! **Note**: this pattern works well for tools like `cantal` or `self-meter`
//! crate where you receive lots of metrics with the same timestamp. Or when
//! you quantize metrics by fixed interval. But not when you receive many
//! metrics with arbitrary timestamp and need to keep store precise timestamps.
//! But you may store a `DeltaTimestamps` for each metric in the latter case.
//! (or you may contribute better implementation)
